[**Labor Market Responses to Trade: Job Creation and Destruction Across Space and Sectors**](jmp.pdf) <br>

    <summary> Abstract </summary>
    In an era dominated by globalization and international trade, the impact of trade shocks on employment has become a pressing concern for policymakers and the public. This paper examines the impact of the China trade shock on U.S. local labor markets, focusing on unemployment and its key drivers: job finding and job separation rates. Using a shift-share design, I find that regions exposed to the shock experience significant and persistent unemployment increases due to lower job finding and higher job separation rates. To explain these results, I develop a dynamic multi-sector, multi-region labor matching model with endogenous job creation and destruction. The calibrated model confirms that trade shocks raise unemployment, decrease employment, and increase welfare inequality across most U.S. states. The China trade shock raises the U.S. unemployment rate by 0.18% and accounts for 87% of the decline in the manufacturing employment share of working-age population from 2000 to 2007, while boosting overall productivity by 0.16% and improving welfare by 0.04%. The model shows that the Hosios condition alone cannot achieve constrained efficiency due to migration frictions and nontradable goods. A redistributive corporate tax policy subsidizing manufacturing could improve welfare, reduce unemployment, and restore pre-shock manufacturing employment levels.

**Labor Market Responses to Trade: Job Creation and Destruction Across Space and Sectors** <br>

    <summary> Abstract </summary>
    This paper seeks to link spatial labor sorting with spatial disparities in productivity, wage and unemployment through a new channel, frictional labor market, to study how frictional labor market can contribute to spatial sorting, hence disparities. The model features frictional labor matching with two types of workers, two locations and free labor mobility. The model predicts that the places where the
 killed workers sort to tend to have higher productivity and wage and lower unemployment rate. The empirical evidence supports the predictions.
